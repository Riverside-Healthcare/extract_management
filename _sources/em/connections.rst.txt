EM2's connection manager stores credentials for FTP, SFTP, SMB, SSH or Database.

Connections are saved in "Connection Groups called "Organizations" in the Task pages.

A connection group can have any number of different connections.

Password fields are all encrypted before being saved into the backend database.
